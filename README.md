# Really?!? - Discord Bot

This game is a fast-paced, DM-driven social guessing challenge where players take turns making **true or false** statements about random topics.

- **One host per round** – gets a random topic and makes a statement (true or false).  
- **Other players** – secretly vote whether they believe the statement is true or false.  
- **Points** – awarded to those who guess correctly.  
- **Host rotation** – everyone gets a chance to bluff, convince, or mislead.  
- **Private lobbies via DMs** – no spoilers, no chaos, just focused fun.  
- **Game flow** – from starting rounds to revealing results and tracking scores, all handled smoothly by the bot.

## Why is everything in one script?

This project started as a quick *"I’ll just try this idea"* experiment that unexpectedly grew into a full discord bot game before I even thought about proper architecture.  
The main goal was **getting it working** and having fun with friends – not building a perfect, modular framework.

That means the code is currently packed into a single script and far from the cleanest solution.  
I plan to **refactor** it over time to make it more readable, maintainable, and feature-rich.

Feel free to fork, rewrite, and expand the game!
